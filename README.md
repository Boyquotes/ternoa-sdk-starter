# ðŸ’¡ Ternoa SDK Starter

***Welcome ðŸ‘‹,*** 

This tutorial is an interactive way to quickstart jumping into Ternoa SDK and start building on the chain. After going throw the three basic exercices, you will know **how to mint, retreive and sell an NFT**, by using our tools:

- **Ternoa-js API**: _A Javascript tool_ it self based on the Polkadot.js API. This [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ternoa-js) offers developers a seamless experience to execute transactions (called extrinsics in Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem) on the Ternoa chain, and handles all the hard work for you. Get more information [here](https://github.com/capsule-corp-ternoa/ternoa-js). 

- **Ternoa Indexer**: Our indexer is the record of the Ternoa Chain data, that can be used directly into your codebase or in a [playground](https://indexer-mainnet.ternoa.dev/).

This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node js to understand the basic functions. If youâ€™re looking for documentation instead, visit the Ternoa [Documentation](https://docs.ternoa.network/).
