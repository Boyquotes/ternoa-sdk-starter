// Secret NFTs are an addition to the Basic NFTs: The secret consists of an immutable media that is encrypted using generated PGP keys.
// After encrypting the media, the PGP private key is split into shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm.
// Each private key share is securely stored on a cluster in an enclave using the TEE technology, where individuals or centralized entities other than the current owner of the Secret NFT cannot access them.
// To view a secret, the NFT owner will request the shares for each enclave.
// The request consists of the NFT id and a signed message.
// Once the NFT ownership is verified, the TEE enclaves will return the shares.
// The PGP Private Key can be reconstructed with the shares, and the secret media is decrypted.

// Let's cover this process.
